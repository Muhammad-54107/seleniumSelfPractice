    //PRACTICE #4: Method: verifyOrder
    // •Create a method named verifyOrder in SmartBearUtils class.
    // •Method takes WebDriver object and String(name).
    // •Method should verify if given name exists in orders.
    // •This method should simply accepts a name(String), and assert whether given name is in the list or not.
    // •Create a new TestNG test to test if the method is working as expected.
